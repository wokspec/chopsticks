# Level 0 Completion Report

**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Test Result:** PASSED  
**Next Level:** 1 (Invariants Locked)

---

## Executive Summary

Chopsticks platform has successfully completed **Level 0: Running Baseline** of the maturity model. The platform now boots cleanly from scratch with a single command, all core services start properly, and health checks pass consistently.

**Key Achievement:** The platform is now mechanically verified to start reliably without manual intervention.

---

## Test Execution

```bash
$ make test-level-0
=== Level 0: Running Baseline Check ===
1. Cleaning existing containers...
2. Starting services...
3. Waiting for PostgreSQL to be ready...
   ✅ PostgreSQL is ready
4. Waiting for bot to be healthy (timeout: 90s)...
   ✅ Health endpoint responding
5. Checking health payload...
   Health response: {"ok":true,"ts":1771053602350}
   ✅ Health check returns valid payload
6. Checking for agent registration...
   ✅ Agent runner is active (no agents configured yet - this is OK for clean boot)
7. Checking for controller startup...
   ✅ Controller started successfully

=== ✅ Level 0 Check PASSED ===
- Docker started without manual steps
- PostgreSQL ready
- Controller is running
- Agent runner active
- Health endpoint returns OK
```

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Music Interaction Timeout
**Problem:** Selecting a song from search results failed with "interaction failed"  
**Root Cause:** Async operations (cache lookup, voice channel validation) performed before acknowledging Discord interaction  
**Fix:** Added `interaction.deferUpdate()` immediately at function start  
**File:** `src/commands/music.js`  
**Lines:** 1097, 1111-1125

### 2. Permission Bypass on Admin Commands
**Problem:** Users without admin permissions could execute `/autorole set` and similar commands  
**Root Cause:** Commands defined `userPerms` in meta but didn't set Discord's `defaultMemberPermissions`  
**Fix:** Modified deploy script to apply `meta.userPerms` to command builder  
**Files:** `src/deploy-commands.js`, `src/index.js`

### 3. Missing Command Timing Variable
**Problem:** Bot crashed with "startTime is not defined"  
**Root Cause:** Command tracking added but `startTime` variable missing  
**Fix:** Added `const startTime = Date.now()` in interaction handler  
**File:** `src/index.js`  
**Line:** 591

### 4. Docker Healthcheck Dependencies
**Problem:** Bot started before PostgreSQL was fully ready, causing connection failures  
**Root Cause:** `depends_on` didn't wait for healthy state  
**Fix:** Changed to `depends_on: { postgres: { condition: service_healthy } }`  
**File:** `docker-compose.production.yml`

### 5. Lavalink Healthcheck Auth
**Problem:** Lavalink healthcheck failing, preventing bot from starting  
**Root Cause:** Healthcheck curl didn't include required authorization header  
**Fix:** Added `-H 'Authorization: youshallnotpass'` to healthcheck curl  
**File:** `docker-compose.production.yml`

   - Waits for health
   - Displays service URLs

2. **`scripts/verify-clean-boot.sh`** - Clean boot verification
   - Stops all containers
   - Removes orphaned containers
   - Runs unified start
   - Verifies success

3. **`scripts/ci/level-0-check.sh`** - Automated Level 0 test
   - Cleans environment

make stop               # Stop platform  
make restart            # Restart platform
make logs               # Follow logs
make health             # Check health

## Architecture Improvements

### Container Orchestration

**Before:**
```yaml
depends_on:
  - postgres
  - redis
  - lavalink
```

**After:**
```yaml
depends_on:
  postgres:
    condition: service_healthy
  redis:
    condition: service_healthy
  lavalink:
    condition: service_healthy
```

**Impact:** Services now wait for dependencies to be truly ready, eliminating race conditions.

### Health Checks

**Endpoints:**
- Primary: `http://localhost:8080/healthz` → `{"ok":true,"ts":...}`
- Metrics: `http://localhost:8080/metrics`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3003`

**Container Health:**
- PostgreSQL: `pg_isready -U chopsticks`
- Redis: `redis-cli ping`
- Lavalink: `curl -H 'Authorization: ...' http://localhost:2333/version`

## Regression Prevention

### Continuous Integration

**Level 0 must remain passing.** Any PR that breaks Level 0 criteria should be rejected.

**CI Job (Recommended):**
```yaml
name: Maturity Level 0 Verification
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  level-0:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Level 0 Check
        run: ./scripts/ci/level-0-check.sh
```

### Monitoring

**What to Monitor:**
- Health endpoint uptime (should be 99.9%+)
- Container restart counts (should be 0 outside deployments)
- Startup time (should remain <30s)
- PostgreSQL connection pool saturation
- Agent runner polling frequency

**Alerts to Set:**
- Health check fails for >30s
- Container restart loop detected
- Startup time exceeds 60s
- Any service OOMKilled

## Level 1 Roadmap

**Now that Level 0 is complete, begin Level 1 work.**

### Priority 1: Protocol Versioning (HIGH)

**Goal:** Add version field to all agent messages

**Tasks:**
1. Add `version: "1.0.0"` to all message types
2. Implement version negotiation in handshake
3. Document protocol in `docs/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`
4. Write tests verifying version field exists

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

### Priority 2: Agent Limit Enforcement (HIGH)

**Goal:** Enforce 49 agents per guild

**Tasks:**
1. Add validation in agent allocation function
2. Return clear error when limit reached
3. Write unit test attempting 50 deploys
4. Document limit in README

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

### Priority 3: Migration Framework (MEDIUM)

**Goal:** Enable safe schema evolution

**Tasks:**
1. Choose/implement migration tool
2. Create initial migration (baseline schema)
3. Test forward migration
4. Test backward rollback
5. Document migration process

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### Priority 4: Schema Freeze (MEDIUM)

**Goal:** Prevent untracked schema changes

**Tasks:**
1. Generate current schema hash
2. Add CI check comparing hash
3. Document schema freeze policy
4. Create process for schema changes

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

### Priority 5: Contract Tests (LOW)

**Goal:** Verify all state transitions

**Tasks:**
1. Pool creation/deletion tests
2. Agent registration/deregistration tests
3. Deployment/teardown flow tests
4. Error condition tests
5. Add to CI pipeline

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

**Total Level 1 Effort:** ~8-11 hours

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Maturity Model Approach** - Clear criteria prevented premature advancement
2. **Automated Testing** - Caught issues that manual testing missed
3. **Incremental Fixes** - Small, focused changes easier to debug
4. **Health Checks** - Essential for detecting real readiness vs. just started
5. **Container Dependencies** - `condition: service_healthy` eliminated race conditions

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Earlier Testing** - Should have created test script before declaring "done"
2. **Documentation** - Some undocumented endpoints (healthz vs health)
3. **Error Messages** - Some errors unclear about root cause
4. **Startup Logs** - Could be more structured for easier parsing

### Recommendations for Level 1

1. **Test First** - Write Level 1 verification script before implementation
2. **Small PRs** - One exit criterion per PR for easier review
3. **Pair Changes** - Update MATURITY.md in same commit as fix
4. **Document Decisions** - Why certain approaches were chosen
5. **Monitor Regressions** - Run Level 0 check on every commit

## Acknowledgments

**Achievement Unlocked: Baseline Stability** 🎉

The platform now has a solid foundation for building reliable features. This is the first step in a long journey toward production-grade maturity.

**What's Different Now:**
- ✅ Can confidently say "the platform boots"
- ✅ Can reproduce the state on any machine
- ✅ Can detect regressions automatically
- ✅ Have clear path forward (Level 1-8)

**What's Next:**
- Lock down core contracts (Level 1)
- Add comprehensive observability (Level 2)
- Achieve deterministic state (Level 3)
- Enforce capacity limits (Level 4)
- ... and 4 more levels to go

**Remember:** Progress is measured by what's mechanically enforced, not what feels stable.

See `MATURITY.md` for the complete roadmap.
